# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
     I used the terminal-table gem to output the lists in a cleaner
     format.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Output the list in a table format.
  b) Clear a list but keep it so a user can add more items.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    Longer than I thought I would. It took me about 5 hours.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    Getting all of my values passed around between various methods and
    modules to work correctly was challenging. For future projects I
    plan on using some type of chart to keep myself better organized.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    I imported the terminal-table gem and displayed the output in a
    table to make it easier to read, and I also implemented a clear_list
    method to delete all of the contents of a list but to keep the empty
    list for re-use, for users that do all of their items before getting
    a chance to update their list.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    Lot's of places. I think that keeping track of data as it flows from
    one place to the next is something that I need to practice, as well
    as thinking (and drawing) what I am trying to do before coding.
